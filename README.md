# ModManagerRemastered

This project has 4 smaller projects in it at once

Sync client
===========
This gets put in the modpack home directory. When launched, the user is able to connect to the modded server and download/update any config files, mod, etc. they need to run the pack. This is esspecially useful when you want to manage your own pack not using any of the fancy modpack managers but still update it regularly, as distributing mods to clients are a pain in the butt.

Modpack Installer
=================
This installs the mod pack using command line, launching the forge installer, creating the profile, launching a sync client to download all the mods.
